# Intelligent-Street

Intelligent Street is basically based on Sensor Networking, in which we have planned to work on Automating Current Street light system. We have noticed that in Current Street we are facing few problems which we have tried to solve in this project, we are mainly focusing on Automatic Street light, Speed detection and Image (Number plate) Detection.
